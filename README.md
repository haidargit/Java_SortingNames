## About
This Lightweight _'Names Sorter App'_ is made to sort the List of person names from desired file which already available and located inside this project
("unsorted-names-list.txt"), then we save the sorted result into another file ("sorted-names-list.txt").

## Languange, Environment, and Unit Testing
- Apache Maven 3.8.4    => https://maven.apache.org/

- Java 8 (JDK)          => https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html

- Junit5 (Unit Testing) => https://junit.org/junit5/

✅  No need 'specific IDEs'. Feel free to use any text editor to open the project. 

✅  Straightforward and easy to use. Since we don't do repeated activities such as starting, stop,  
    or even restart local server for this app project.  

✅  We check the application result on the Command Prompt / terminal by using java command  
    (you'll see it on below)
