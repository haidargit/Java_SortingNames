## About
This Lightweight _'Names Sorter App'_ is made to sort the List of person names from desired file which already available and located inside this project
("unsorted-names-list.txt"), then we save the sorted result into another file ("sorted-names-list.txt").

## Environment, Tools, and Unit Testing

- Java 8 (JDK)          => https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html

    or even restart local server on this project.
